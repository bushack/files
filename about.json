  "Text": "Squound was born from the combined passions of two obsessed retro-collectors who have trawled the UK & Europe looking for mid-century treasure.\n\nAfter amassing a myriad of splendidly vintage homewares, furnishings and trinkets, mainly from the 1960s and 1970s, we're now able to share out colourful obsession.\n\nOur massive collection of retro goodies is now available to buy from displays that are a real feast for the eyes. Specialising in glass, ceramics, furniture, lighting, kitchenalia and fabrics, with a leaning towards Scandinavian and European style, we are a positive and knowledgeable partnership who love to surround themselves with beautiful, decorative things."
